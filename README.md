This is a minimal Anki add-on to check camera working with Anki. Use PyQt6 to view the webcam video. If a crash occurs, you need to press Shift to restart Anki and disable the add-on. Since debug is the purpose there is no function. It asks for camera permission for MacOS. If you run the init file directly, it will display a window in PyQt6. Press the capture button to capture an image (it will not be saved).
